# SlitherLink-Project
Here you can find my personal version of SlitherLink game in Phyton.

The intention is to improve the game until it gets similar to the original.

The game was developed on Phyton and the main script is SlitherLinkOfficial.py.

I exploited the g2d graphics library and implemented the game with the original board that you can find here in the uploaded files.

To verify the correct behavior of the board and to verify that each rule is respected I created a file dedicated only for testing. (SlitherLink_Unittest.py). To program I used Thonny/pyCharm but the program also runs on the free Phyton playground that you can find on the internet.

The created game works with the 5x5 and the 10x10 board, the other 2 boards that you can find here are currently not working with my personal program.
